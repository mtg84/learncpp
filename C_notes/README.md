## The C language
The C language is a <b>mid-level</b> programming language.

It is <b>procedural</b>.

The <u>compiler </u> translates  <b>source code</b> into <u>object code</u>.

Object code files end with the ```.o``` extension.

The <u>linker</u> combines object code with C libraries to make a program.

<hr>

## Libraries are different from header files

### Header files
Can be found commonly:  ```/usr/include/``` 
and are <b>source code files </b> written in C.

### Libraries
Can be found commonly: ```usr/lib/``` and these are <b>object code files</b> which contain binary data.
